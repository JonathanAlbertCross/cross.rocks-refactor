# Portfolio Refactored with React.js

Welcome to the README page for the refactored portfolio project, now powered by React.js! This document will provide an overview of the project, its goals, how to set it up locally, and how to contribute.

## Overview

This portfolio project is being refactored from a traditional HTML and CSS structure to a modern web application using React.js. The goal of this refactoring effort is to enhance maintainability, scalability, and interactivity of the portfolio while leveraging the benefits of a component-based architecture provided by React.

## Features

- **Component-Based Structure**: The portfolio is divided into reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Utilising React's state management, content can be dynamically rendered based on user interactions or data changes.
- **Improved Performance**: React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering ensure faster page load times and smoother user experience.
- **Modular Styling**: Styles are modularized with CSS Modules or styled-components, providing scoped styling for each component.
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Interactive elements such as forms, modals, and animations can be seamlessly integrated into the portfolio.
